Before running the script, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up for a free account and obtain an API key from the OpenWeatherMap website. <br>Update the key in the api_key variable in the config.json file

You'll also need to install the following Python libraries:

requests<br>
json<br>
re<br>
tabulate

You can install these libraries using pip:<br>

pip install requests<br>
pip install json <br>
pip install re <br>
pip install tabulate

# Usage
To use the script, simply run it from the command line using the following command:

You'll be prompted to enter the city name for which you want to retrieve weather data. The script will then retrieve the weather data from OpenWeatherMap and display the following weather parameters:

Weather<br>
Temperature<br>
Feels like <br>
Wind speed<br>
Pressure<br>

The weather parameters will be displayed with units.
