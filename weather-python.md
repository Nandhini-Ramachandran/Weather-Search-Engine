As part of this task, develop a search engine that allows users to search for Current weather by name of the city.


We recommend using https://openweathermap.org/current , but feel free to use any API provider of your choice. Be sure to document the API you choose as part of your submission.

Your product should allow users to -
- search for a city given the name and show  current weather info about the city
- print the response in a structured format ( text )

# Specifications

Structure your code as a python webservice / script. It should take city name as input via UI / argument to the script / api call. 

- If using a script, print out the weather information in a readable, understandable format.
- If creating a web service, return json response with essential info.

Your code should also cache weather information to avoid going to the source for repeat queries.


<strong><u>Points to note :</u></strong>
- Please follow REST API guidelines if going API route
- The service should run locally ( Include a readme with any setup information required to run the code )
- If any guidelines here are not followed, that will be treated as an invalid submission


<strong><u>Aspects we will be looking at closely -</u></strong>
- Code quality, handling of conditions, edge cases
- Structuring of code for extensibility
- Good python coding practices
- Overall UI look and feel ( if UI is involved )
- PERFORMANCE

<strong><u>Submission -</u></strong>
- Upload your code to a <strong>public</strong> github repository
- Reply to the email where you received the coding challenge <strong> without changing the subject</strong> to submit your submission
- <strong>Include a link to the github repo with your submission in the body</strong>


Happy Coding :)
